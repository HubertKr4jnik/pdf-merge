## Pdf merger
The aim of this project is to allow you to merge all travel documents eg. tickets ect. into one easy-to-navigate file. Current fratures:
* move pages around with drag and drop, 
* delete pages you don't want,
* merge all pages into a single file, with the name of your choice,
* group pages into custom named groups,
* delete groups,
* drag and drop groups to reorder them,
* when opening a file you merged the group structure will be restored

Now works semi-well on mobile, <br>
Feedback always welcome
